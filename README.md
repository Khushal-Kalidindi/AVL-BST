# C++ AVL Tree and BST implementation
- ## Program which implements BST and AVL tree implementation which uses generic to store nodes with any given Key and comparable Value
\\\\
- Implements BST along with iterator with operator overloading implementation which can be used to iterate through tree by successor or predecessor of current node. 
    - BST operations implemented include: insert, remove, find, clear 
- Implements AVL Tree along with iterator with operator overloading implementation which can be used to iterate through tree by successor or predecessor of current node. Insertion and deletion follows rules of AVL Tree and rotates nodse left/right accordingly to keep tree balanced
    - AVL operations implemented include: insert, remove, find, clear
